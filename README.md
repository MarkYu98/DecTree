# DecTree
Binary Classifier using a Decision Tree.

## About the Project
Orginally an extension task prompt (star point) for UCSD course CSE 100 Fall 17 Programming Assignment 1 (Binary search tree implementation and application). I further developed it to be a useful, reliable binary classifier using knowledge and techniques learned in the reference videos.

*Language:* C++ with Standard Template Library(STL)

*Code:* `DecTree.cpp` (All declarations and implementations are in this cpp file (just for the sake of simplicity...), though it is not a good way to program in general)

*Function implemented:* To train, validate(prune) a decision tree and use it to perform classication task on binary classication problems. However, it requires the data to be formatted and only supports string-type(discrete) attributes.

## Test and Experiment (Also a manual)
The dataset included (agaricus.data) is from: http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Mushroom

To compile, simply use `make`. I already included a `Makefile`.

To run, call `DecTree.cpp`.

To use this decision tree program, first format the data as **"Class Attribute1 Attribute2 ... "** (all strings(chars)) as in `agaricus.data`, and configure the program as instructed (generate a `Classifier.config` file, I already configured it for this dataset so this config file already exists).

For the testing purpose, divide the dataset into *training*, *validation* and *test set* using `head` and `sed` shell(bash) command.

For my test, I use first 5000 data as *training set*, 5001-6500(1500 data) as *validation set* for pruning and 6501-8124(1624 data) as *test set*.
